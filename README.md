# Flight Etiquette

I picked this question because there seems to be a fine line of acceptability drawn for how far someone can put their seat back on a plane. 

## Everyone I know has something to say about the person in front of them that decides to put their seat back so far they can't eat their mediocre airplane food without being inches away from their monitor. However, the data indicates a majority of airplane travelers do not think it is rude to recline their seat. ##
